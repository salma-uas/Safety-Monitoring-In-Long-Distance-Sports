A Safety Monitoring System for long-distance sports (e.g., marathons, snow skating) using smartphone accelerometer data to recognize human activities like walking, running, sitting, and falling in real-time. The system leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for activity classification and provides emergency notifications for unusual events, ensuring timely responses in critical situations."

* Features: 
  - Real-time activity recognition (e.g., walking, running, sitting, falling) using smartphone accelerometer data and LSTM networks. 
  - Emergency notifications to alert response teams, enabling immediate medical assistance during critical situations (e.g., falls). 
  - Comprehensive athlete monitoring with live data visualization.
  - Historical activity data recording for further analysis and insights.
